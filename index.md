# Intro 9/07/18

This week I learned what python was, how to use it and run programs.
I also learned how to use github, and some fundamentals of coding language.
I also learned the theory of programming, and that over time information gets lost between transfers.
I learned about some programmming applications and downloaded VS code.
Some of the language  I learned include print for python.
Print tells python to display everything in the parenthesis after it on the screen for you to see.
