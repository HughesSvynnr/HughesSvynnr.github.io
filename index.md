#  Variables, Expressions 9/14/2018

This week I learned what concatenation means and how to use it.
Concatenation lets you combine two or more variables into one variable value.
I also learned what comparison operators are and how to use them.
comparison operators let you compare two variables to see if they are equal to eachother or not
The last thing I learned is how to write comments in VSC.
The way you do this is by putting a # mark in front of a line of code to give yourself a note, or comment.
